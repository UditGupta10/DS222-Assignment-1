local2.py : Local Naive Bayes implementation of implementation_.

1. mapper-word-count.py, reducer-word-count.py : These will do the word counting.
2. mapper-class-counter.py, reducer-class-counter.py : These files count the number of occurrences of each class and the number of words in them.
3. mapper_test.py, reducer_test.py : To be run on test set.
4. NB_imp1.py, NB_reducer.py : These files implement the Naive Bayes algorithm.
